      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          NeuroTech is an innovative and rapidly evolving field that merges neuroscience with advanced technology to create systems capable of interacting directly with the nervous system. This integration aims to enhance, repair, or augment neural functions, offering new possibilities for treating neurological disorders and improving cognitive abilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging insights from various disciplines, including biology, engineering, and computer science, NeuroTech is paving the way for groundbreaking applications. These applications range from brain-computer interfaces that allow individuals to control devices with their thoughts to neuroprosthetics that restore lost sensory or motor functions. As research progresses, NeuroTech holds the potential to revolutionize not only medical treatments but also the way we understand and enhance human cognition.
